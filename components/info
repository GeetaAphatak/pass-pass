I have successfully modularized the React components in Home.js. Here's what I did:

Created separate component files:
Header.js: Contains the header with logo and navigation icons
Sidebar.js: Contains the sidebar with application cards
ChatWindow.js: Contains the chat messages display
ChatInput.js: Contains the input field and reset button
Updated Home.js to:
Import the new modular components
Remove redundant imports (ReactMarkdown and rehypeRaw moved to ChatWindow)
Create a dedicated handleReset function
Use the modular components with proper props
These changes make the code more maintainable and reusable. Each component is now self-contained and can be used in other pages of the application. The components follow a clear separation of concerns:

Header: Handles the application header and navigation
Sidebar: Manages the applications list and sidebar visibility
ChatWindow: Handles chat message display and formatting
ChatInput: Manages user input and reset functionality
The main Home component now acts as a container that manages the state and coordinates between these components, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.
