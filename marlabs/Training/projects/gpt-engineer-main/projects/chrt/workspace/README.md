Given the complexity of the task, we will need to create several Python files to handle different aspects of the AI chart generator. Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `DataProcessor` class in `data_processor.py`: This class will handle the preprocessing of the dataset, including cleaning the data and transforming it into a format suitable for chart generation.

2. `ChartGenerator` class in `chart_generator.py`: This class will use the preprocessed data to generate the appropriate chart.

3. `LangchainProcessor` class in `langchain_processor.py`: This class will use Langchain to understand the context of the data and determine the most appropriate type of chart.

4. `app.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It will use Streamlit to create the user interface, allowing users to upload datasets and view the generated charts.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
