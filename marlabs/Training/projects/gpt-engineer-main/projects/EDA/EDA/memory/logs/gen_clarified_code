This can be done by creating a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:\n\nrequirements.txt\n```txt\nstreamlit\npandas\nnumpy\nmatplotlib\nseaborn\n```\n\nNext, we will create the `CSVLoader` class:\n\ncsv_loader.py\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nclass CSVLoader:\n    def __init__(self, file_path):\n        self.file_path = file_path\n\n    def load_csv(self):\n        try:\n            self.data = pd.read_csv(self.file_path)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error loading CSV file: {e}\")\n            self.data = None\n\n    def validate_csv(self):\n        if self.data is not None:\n            # Perform any necessary validation on the data\n            pass\n```\n\nNext, we will create the `EDA` class:\n\neda.py\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nclass EDA:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n\n    def calculate_statistics(self):\n        self.statistics = self.data.describe()\n\n    def generate_visualizations(self):\n        # Generate visualizations based on the data\n        pass\n```\n\nFinally, we will create the `StreamlitApp` class:\n\nstreamlit_app.py\n```python\nimport streamlit as st\nfrom csv_loader import CSVLoader\nfrom eda import EDA\n\nclass StreamlitApp:\n    def __init__(self, file_path):\n        self.file_path = file_path\n        self.loader = CSVLoader(self.file_path)\n        self.loader.load_csv()\n        self.loader.validate_csv()\n        self.eda = EDA(self.loader.data)\n\n    def display_statistics(self):\n        st.write(self.eda.statistics)\n\n    def display_visualizations(self):\n        # Display the visualizations generated by the EDA\n        pass\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.eda.calculate_statistics()\n        self.display_statistics()\n        self.eda.generate_visualizations()\n        self.display_visualizations()\n```\n\nThe entry point of the application will be a script that creates an instance of the `StreamlitApp` class and calls its `run` method:\n\nmain.py\n```python\nfrom streamlit_app import StreamlitApp\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app = StreamlitApp(\"path_to_csv_file.csv\")\n    app.run()\n```\n\nTo run the application, you would execute the `main.py` script."}]
