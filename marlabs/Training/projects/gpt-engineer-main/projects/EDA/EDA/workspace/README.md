Given the task, we will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. `CSVLoader`: A class to load and validate the CSV file.
2. `EDA`: A class to perform the Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. `StreamlitApp`: A class to handle the Streamlit interface and display the results of the EDA.

The `CSVLoader` class will need the following methods:

1. `load_csv`: To load the CSV file.
2. `validate_csv`: To validate the CSV file.

The `EDA` class will need the following methods:

1. `calculate_statistics`: To calculate basic statistical measures.
2. `generate_visualizations`: To generate visualizations of the data.

The `StreamlitApp` class will need the following methods:

1. `display_statistics`: To display the statistical measures on the Streamlit page.
2. `display_visualizations`: To display the visualizations on the Streamlit page.

Now, let's write the code for each of these classes and methods.

First, we will need to install the necessary Python packages. This can be done by creating a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
